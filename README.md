# Kim
A bot that uses weighted topic identifiers, and markov to make intresting and amusing conversations.

Based on the the idea of [RealAI](https://github.com/oblivionburn/RealAI), however it does not use any
of RealAI's code, and it completely generates the replies instead of also storing old replies and reusing them.
